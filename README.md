# QTM350-project

By using Amazon service Textract, our project is trying to test whether background color, RGB diffences between background color and text color, and pixel value would affect text detection confidence scores.

We have walked through what we have done about our project (including the codes) in our blog "TO BE FILLED". If you are interested in reproducing or furture modifying our work, you can also read this blog.

If you want to only get the codes we used, you can check project.ipynb, as all of our codes are contained in that file.
