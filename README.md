# QTM350-project

By using Amazon service Textract, our project is trying to test whether background color, RGB diffences between background color and text color, and pixel value would affect text detection confidence scores.

Amazon Textract is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition to identify and extract data from forms and tables. Many companies today manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration which oftentimes requires reconfiguration when the form changes. To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses machine learning to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data without any manual effort. One can quickly automate document processing and take action on the information extracted whether it be automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes vs. hours or days. Additionally, one can add in human reviews with Amazon Augmented AI to provide oversight of your models and perform reviews for sensitive data. 

Textract can be used in many different cases such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, and the public sector. In finance, textract can accurately extract critical business data such as mortgage rates, applicant names, and invoice totals across a variety of financial forms like mortgage applications, invoices, and more to process loan and mortgage applications in minutes. In healthcare, textract can help better serve the patients and insurers by extracting important patient data from health intake forms, insurance claims, and pre-authorization forms. It helps keep data organized and in its original context, and eliminates manual review of output. In the public sector, textract easily extracts relevant data from government-related forms like small business loans, federal tax forms, or business applications with a high degree of accuracy.

We have walked through what we have done about our project in our blog "TO BE FILLED". If you are interested in reproducing or furture modifying our work, please read this [blog](https://finalprojectqtm350.s3.amazonaws.com/qtm350_project.html).

If you want to only get the code we used, you can check [qtm350_project.ipynb](qtm350_project.ipynb), as all of our code are contained in that file.

The architecture of the AWS Textract Service we used in our project is presented in this [diagram](architecture.jpg).

If you want to get the source pictures that we analyzed, you can find them in the folder [image](image). For your downloading purpose, we have also zipped all source pictures into [image.zip](image.zip).
