# QTM350-project

By using Amazon service Textract, our project is trying to test whether background color, RGB diffences between background color and text color, and pixel value would affect text detection confidence scores.

We have walked through what we have done about our project in our blog "TO BE FILLED". If you are interested in reproducing or furture modifying our work, please read this [blog](https://finalprojectqtm350.s3.amazonaws.com/qtm350_project.html).

If you want to only get the code we used, you can check [qtm350_project.ipynb](qtm350_project.ipynb), as all of our code are contained in that file.

The architecture of the AWS Textract Service we used in our project is presented in this [diagram](architecture.jpg).

If you want to get the source pictures that we analyzed, you can find them in the folder [image](image). For your downloading purpose, we have also zipped all source pictures into [image.zip](image.zip).
